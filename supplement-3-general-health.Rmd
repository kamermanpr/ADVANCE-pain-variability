# Objective 

To describe the relationship between pain characteristics and rating of general health in the analysis cohort, at each time point.

# Analysis notes

## Definitions of missingness

Data were regarded as **missing** when _pain in the last week_ data were not present for one or more of weeks 0, 12, 24, 36, 48. Data also were classified as **missing** when there were inconsistencies in the data across the variables collected within a week.

## Definition of data inconsistencies

Pain was defined as _pain in the last week_  being 'Yes', and _pain at its worst_ being > 0. These two measurements were then the "gatekeeper" measurements, such that the two measurements both had to be positive ('Yes' and '> 0', respectively) in order for there to be any entries for _site of pain_ and _site of worst pain_. Were the data were inconsistent (e.g., when there was no _pain in the last week_ and _pain at its worst_ = 0, but there were entries for _site of pain_ and _site of worst pain_), then the _site of pain_ and _site of worst pain_ entries were marked as **inconsistent**. 

Data also were considered **inconsistent** when _pain in the last week_ = 'Yes', but _site of worst pain_ = 'None'. 

Lastly, data were considered **inconsistent** when _site of worst pain_ was not listed as one of the pain locations for a given measurement week.

For analysis purposes, missing data in the _site of pain_ columns were changed to **'No'** (pain not present in the site). This approach was conservative, but we believed that the approach would have the least effect on the outcome, while still retaining as many participants as possible.

# Import data

```{r import}
df <- read_rds('data-cleaned/data-ADVANCE.rds') %>% 
    select(ranid, interval_name, pain_in_the_last_week, pain_worst,
           general_health, any_missing, interval_numeric)
```

# First look 

```{r inspect}
head(df)
glimpse(df)
```

# Basic clean

```{r clean}
# Clean and process data
df %<>% 
    filter(any_missing == 'No') %>% 
    select(-any_missing)
```

# Quick tabulation

## Analysis data set for the period 0 to 48 weeks

```{r quick_tab}
# Tabulate data
xtabs(~interval_name, data = df)
```

----

# Analysis

## General health

Rating of perceived health status on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = poor, 5 = excellent).

### Overall rating by time period

```{r gh}
# Tabulate data
df %>% 
  select(interval_name, general_health) %>% 
  group_by(interval_name) %>% 
  skim() %>% 
  yank('numeric') %>% 
  select(-skim_variable, -hist, -complete_rate) %>% 
  kable(caption = '7-number summary of the general health perception score')

# Plot data
df %>% 
  ggplot(data = .) +
  aes(x = factor(interval_numeric),
      y = general_health) +
  geom_boxplot(size = 1) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0.3),
             shape = 21, 
             fill = '#000000',
             alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(subtitle = 'General health perception',
       y = 'GHP score (5-point Likert scale)',
       x = 'Weeks',
       caption = 'Points slightly offset with random "jitter" for clarity.')
```

### Rating by pain status, across time

```{r gh_pain}
# Tabulate data
df %>% 
  select(interval_name, pain_in_the_last_week, general_health) %>% 
  group_by(pain_in_the_last_week, interval_name) %>% 
  skim() %>% 
  yank('numeric') %>% 
  select(-skim_variable, -hist, -complete_rate) %>% 
  kable(caption = '7-number summary of the general health score, by pain status')

# Plot data
df %>% 
  ggplot(data = .) +
  aes(x = pain_in_the_last_week,
      y = general_health) +
  geom_boxplot(size = 1) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0.3),
             shape = 21, 
            fill = '#000000',
            alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(subtitle = 'General health perception, by pain status',
       y = 'GHP score (5-point Likert scale)',
       x = 'Pain',
       caption = 'Points slightly offset with random "jitter" for clarity.') +
  facet_wrap(~interval_name, ncol = 3)
```

No clear relationship between the presence of pain and GHP rating.

### Rating by pain intensity, across time

```{r gh_pain2}
# Plot data
df %>% 
  filter(pain_in_the_last_week != 'No') %>% 
  ggplot(data = .) +
  aes(x = pain_worst,
      y = general_health) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0.2)) +
  labs(subtitle = 'General health perception, by pain status',
       y = 'GHP score (5-point Likert scale)',
       x = 'Pain',
       caption = 'Points slightly offset with random "jitter" for clarity.') +
  facet_wrap(~interval_name, ncol = 3)
```

No clear relationship between the pain intensity and GHP rating.
